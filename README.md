## Why I Built It
This project was created to understand the distribution of AI companies globally better and analyze key business indicators like minimum project size and employee count.

## What I Learned
Working on this project taught me essential data cleaning techniques, handling missing values, transforming text-based numerical data, and generating visualizations with Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Features
- Cleaning and structuring dataset for analysis
- Visualizing distributions of project size, hourly rate, and employee count
- Mapping countries to continents for regional insights
- Deriving insights into AI industry trends

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: A core data manipulation and analysis programming language.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **PyCountry-Convert**: For mapping countries to continents.

## Insights
1. **Location Distribution**: The majority of AI companies are located in North America, Europe, and Asia.
2. **Project Size and Hourly Rates**: Most companies operate with undisclosed project sizes and hourly rates, but common project sizes fall within certain ranges.
